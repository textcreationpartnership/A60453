            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Lord God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, &amp; man became a living ſoul. So man was formed of that which was earthly, and into that which was earthly, that which was living was breathed, and that which is living comes from God, which is to keep and lead men unto God; but man going from that which is living, into that which is earthly, is thereby led from God, and being led from that which is living, he is alſo pleading for another thing then that which is the life to be his Rule and Guide, and ſo comes not to be guided by that which is manifeſt of God in him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19.

            <p>And that man may come to receive this ſpirit, and have it alwaies in him to the end of the world, ruling him in the feare of God, and leading him to the eternall dominion of the God of order, and that man may know the true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falable thing, which is moſt aſſuredly given into man, to lead him to the injoyment of the God, of the ſpirits of all fleſh</p>
            <p>Therefore let all people (in what formes or ſtate ſoever) have their minds turned to that in them, which lets them ſee their ſins, and every evill thought and evill motions of the enemy in the darke minde, before it be brought forth into the act of ſin by word or action, &amp; that in them, which lets them ſee this, which is evill before it be acted, as they love it, believe in it and obey it, it will keep them from the acting of that which they are tempted to, and that in them which letteth them ſee the evill, and that they ſhould not ſin is the onely thing which God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in man, to keep him from acting the evill, and from ſin, and by it may all mankind receive power to withſtand ſin, and ſtay the firſt appearance of that which is evill, and the nature and property of it (being loved) is to deſtroy ſin where it is, and to keep out of it, and kill that from whence the motions to ſin would ariſe, &amp; this is that which led me out of ſin, when no other waies, helps or meanes could be found, and that which ſheweth man his ſin, and leadeth out of ſin and gives power over it, is a certain rule to follow and walke by, for it doth never lead into ſin, and that which letteth ſee the motions of ſin, and leadeth out of all ſin, is <hi>abſolutely</hi> that which commeth from him in which there is no ſin, and certainly as true as the Lord God liveth, this is that which leadeth up, even to the Lord God of life, and this is his free love who gave his ſon to them that asked not for him, and his Son is the light which is the gift of the Fathers Love: given to the Rebellious, that he might be manifeſt to them that asked no

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105215:23"/> the power, &amp; there ſtands in oppoſition againſt the power, which being judged, confounded, ſcattered, and overturned, with the powerful breakings forth of that, which by it ſuffered under; ſo the true thing preſents it ſelfe to be the leader; which being received and obeyed, it draws the mind in, where is ſtilneſſe and quietneſs, out of that which labours for vanity, into that where the labour ceaſeth, and the reſt is received, and the day come which God hath bleſſed for evermore, where the Lamb is the light, and the ſmall ſtill voyce is heard, and the power of the Word received; the which ſome coming to ſee, through the openings in the light, and yet not in it waiting, through the judgment to be led into the thing it ſelf, ſo that that which ſtood not in the power, ſoon leadeth out the mind in a joy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſight, to cover it ſelf again therewith.</p>
            <p>And ſo as that is ſtill followed, which leadeth forth from the power in the ſight, conceiving, or profeſsing of it without it, having not the ſubſtance; So the ſubſtance and the power is more and more degenerated from, in what image or form ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, and as the form is continued in, the power is denyed; but as the power is minded, and waited for, ſtanding out of the form or image: ſo the other which abode not, but leadeth out of the power of the truth, cometh to be croſt, judged and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo not followed, but kept out of, in the light to watch and war againſt it by the light, out of it to be led into that, and it to receive, in which immortality abideth for ever.</p>
            <p>And ſo as there is a continuall watching with the light that may be ſeeen, which abides not in it, but is got up above it, working in all deceiveableneſs in the myſtery of iniquity, to cover it ſelf with the profeſsion of truth, but ſtill keep out of it, and alſo that may be ſeen, which ſuffers under all this, and lieth under it, ſo that it cannot be come to, nor come at, by that which is out of it, and ſtands above it, and its vailed and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the narrow entrance to it, is hard to be found, and being found, is ſoon turned out of, and hard to be kept in, by reaſon of the many turnings of the deceivableneſs of that, which is, and is rightly named, the myſtery of iniquity, which worketh in them that obey not the light, which cometh from the truth, in which the power ſtandeth, out of which that went forth which hath not the power, which is to be confounded with the power, that the power without hands may break in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105215:23"/> pieces that made with hands, or the greateſt, talleſt, or moſt glorious image that hath been conceived in the dark mind, and ſet up on high above the humble ſuffering ſeed to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, which in the power of the light is reſiſted, with all his wiles, though therein he bringeth Scripture to uphold his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and dominion over the other, which is to reign, to have it bow down to him, and worſhip him, who abode not in the power, which by the power is reſiſted and denyed for ever, and he commanded to ſerve it, and bound and chain'd down with it.</p>
            <p>And ſo that which denies &amp; overcomes the other, and is the younger, which is to reign, whom the other is to ſerve, and is humble, low, meek, ſober, wiſe and gentle, harmleſs and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, is it that all are to wait to receive and joyn unto; from it power to know, in it to ſtand againſt the other which did it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and by ſecret ſubtlety being exalted, doth always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſit in the Temple of God, ſhewing it ſelfe as God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered with a profeſsion of the truth, which in the truth doth not abide, yet to the truth in words may confeſſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſaveth from ſin, to be the begotten of God, and may believe and tremble becauſe of it, and be tormented and troubled by it, &amp; yet remain an enemy to the Son, tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by many glorious preſentations and gifts, rewards and promiſes, to bow to that, and ſerve that, and be led by that which abideth not in the power, that ſo thereby over the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it might always rule, in the deceivableneſſe of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſtill preſenting that which is fair, pleaſant, and deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſeeming to make one wiſe; which being received, opens that eye which looks at the things which are ſeen, and darkens that which is to give the knowledg of the power, by which the things that are ſeen were made, wherein many are enſnared, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tempted, and ſome overcome, who are to ſink down to that then overcom, and feel it again in them to riſe to overcom the other, leſt their latter end be worſe then their beginning.</p>
            <p>Oh how can the depth of the ground of this myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity be declared; or who can utter forth the innumerable transformings and changings of that which ſtill ſeeketh by all ſubtilty to keep from the obedience, to the life of that power, by which man was made, &amp; from which through diſobedience he was led, by that which ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall be as gods,</hi> which againſt God
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105215:24"/> doth ſtand, in that ground which by him is curſed.</p>
            <p>And how can the unſearchable love of the father be uttered with words! <hi>who ſo loved the world</hi> (and his ſeed in it) <hi>that he gave his Son to them that asked not for him;</hi> that by his light may be ſeen the deceiveableneſs of the many workings of the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the mind that is darkned; which from the darkneſs to the light is to be turned with the light, in the fear, to watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every appearance and firſt motion of the changeable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſſe, which ſometimes appeareth as an Angell of light, againſt whoſe appearance all are to ſtand armed, with the power of him who is the light, and to feel the power of the word, which is as fire, and yet to reſiſt that which the Devil dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in, which is alſo like unto fire.</p>
            <p>And that the tender ſimplicity, after which my ſoul breaths, may not be betrayed by that which ſtill ſeeketh to devour, and keep from the power of the Croſs, and turne aſide from the narrow way of life, in which that all the innocent friends of Chriſt may be kept to follow the leadings of that, which from the God of truth, and love, and peace to them have come, by it to be led out of, and from all that, which in the truth doth not abide, and in the power doth not ſtand.</p>
            <p>Therefore is this given forth, even from the breathings of my life to the pure witneſs in you all, which the changeableneſs of iniquity doth always ſtand againſt; the which in Gods living power, let all that feel it keep againſt the other to ſtand, and out of all Satans wiles to be preſerved, to the end of all that which hath an end, that then when time ſhall be no more, you may reſt, and abide with, and in him that is the truth, whom the Devil hath nothing in, to receive the bleſſings of the father, and the tender mercies of the moſt high, to refreſh you, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome you with the power of his love, that it to you all may be the bond of everlaſting peace, in which with all the humble and faithfull am I bound up, and in it with them for evermore do reſt.</p>
